We can never let the word be unspoken.
We will never let our loving go come undone.
Everything we had is staying unbroken.
You will always be the only one.
You're the only one.

Won't ever give up 'cause you're
Still somewhere out there.
Nothin' or no one's gonna keep us apart.
Breakin' it down but I'm still gettin' nowhere.
Won't stop, hold on.
